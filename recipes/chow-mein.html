        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>4 oz. fresh yakisoba noodles</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp. ginger minced</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups of shredded cabbage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the yaki-soba noodles according to the package directions. 
                Do not use a seasoning package if included. For fresh noodles, 
                just add them to boiling water for 1-2 minutes until they separate 
                and become tender. Dried noodles usually need to be boiled for 
                4-5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, 
                and pepper.</li>

            <li>Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery 
                and cook for 3-4 minutes. </li> 
            
            <li>Add the cabbage and cook for 2 minutes until just tender. </li> 
            
            <li>Add the noodles and the sauce. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring often. 
                Taste and season if needed with additional soy sauce or pepper.</li>
        </ol>
