        <h2>A classic and easy-to-make dish</h2>

        <p>Chicken stir fry is a delicious and quick meal. Featuring pan fried chicken mixed
            with vegetables and covered in a special hand-made stir-fry sauce this dish is 
            both easy to prepare and quick to cook.  </p>

        <p>Great for a family dinner, social potluck, or even meal prepping for a week's worth 
            of lunches, chicken stir fry is one of my favourite dishes to make. </p>
