        <p>If I had to pick my favourite fish to eat, salmon would win hands down.
            This is one of the fastest recipes I know, taking at most 15 minutes
            to make from start to finish. This is also possibly the easiest recipe
            in my cookbook
        </p>

        <p>A perfect mix of lemon and garlic brings out the full flavour of salmon
            for the amount of prep it takes. If you are in need of a quick meal, then
            this recipe is for you.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets - 6 ounces each</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp cracked ground pepper</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of basil</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking pan. Arrange 
                salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously with salt 
                and pepper.</li>

            <li>Stir together olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 lemon. 
                Spoon over salmon fillets, being sure to rub all over the tops and 
                sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. Thinly slice the remaining 
                1/2 of the lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.</li>

            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes until the salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled 
                apart with a fork. You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired.</li>

            <li>Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
